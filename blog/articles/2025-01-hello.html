							thanks for hopping aboard on this first little blog post of mine. i'd figure now would be an ample time for myself to start talking about the little things i do every so often a bit more often. but first, i think it'd be a sensible idea to introduce myself, so:
						</p>

						<h2>hi.</h2>
						<p>
							i'm Loxi (the folf, aka: an aromantic-asexual average fox-wolf-person-hybrid-thing-whatever-the-hell-kind-of-anthropomorphic-abomination-I-am), but most critters around the block simply just call me "pivot". <a href="#foot1_main" id="foot1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>
						</p>
							
						<p>
							<b>i go by they/them pronouns</b>, although calling me <b>he/him</b> is also acceptable to me. naturally, people would wonder what <i>I</i>, the very thing bigots warned you about, would ordinarily do. great question, actually! let's get right into that:</p>
						</p>
						
						<h2>what do I do?</h2>
						<p>
							this is a question I <i>really</i> like answering. for one, I actually <a href="https://archive.org/details/@pivotman319">preserve software</a> as a fun little hobby! i am a wiki staff member/admin at <a href="https://betawiki.net/wiki/Main_Page">BetaWiki</a>, a website that focuses on old, pre-release versions of operating systems in general - its main focus is on Microsoft-related products. speaking of Microsoft-related products, I mainly delve into the Windows NT family of operating systems, most specifically desktop versions from Windows Vista onwards, as those are my key strengths. <a href="#foot2_main" id="foot2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>
						<p>
							as such, I run through individual builds of NT and document them thoroughly from time to time. when I <i>really</i> feel like it, I also go lengths to ream through various material (e.g.: court documents, Windows dev timelines, et al.) to better understand what Microsoft <i>does</i> and <i>thinks</i> over time.
						</p>

							<p class="blogpost-image-subtitle">...and this one, well, i'm not going to provide further context for this one. this one's up to you, the reader.</p>
						</div>
						
						<p>
							outside of that, though, I have quite a distinct liking towards Valve games as a whole. in TF2, I am a full-time Heavy main, and part-time Hybrid Demoknight, Soldier and Sniper user. i also do 3D artwork and animation in the Source Filmmaker from time to time (when I actually do pick up the motivation to do so), and have since recently picked up <i>proper</i> digital 2D art since October 2024. <a href="#foot3_main" id="foot3"><sup>[3]</sup></a>

							<p class="blogpost-image-subtitle">yes, i am a bit silly at times too.</p>
						</div>
						
						<p>
							not really sure what else to put here about myself, so... yeah. I guess that's all there is to myself for the time being.
						</p>
						
						<p>
							I plan on using this blog as a platform to talk about the things I'm interested in, and maybe open up a bit about the things i often do as well; you could probably expect a bunch of infodumps from time to time, maybe general comments on what goes on, et cetera. <a href="#foot4_main" id="foot4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> this site's currently hosted on github infra, but I do plan on moving it over to elsewhere at some point (when I have the time, energy and motivation to do so).
						</p>
						
						<p>
							anyways, thanks for reading this first blogpost. i'm hoping to do more of these things in the near future, but for now a brief introduction will do for the time being.

						<h2>footnotes</h2>

							 <a href="#foot1" id="foot1_main">[1]</a>: that name's got a nice ring to it personally, because i used to toy with the Pivot animation tool (the one where a very small subset of people <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pivot_Animator">screwed around with 2-D stick figures, made their own designs and all that</a>) as a kid.
							 <br/><a href="#foot2" id="foot2_main">[2]</a>: totally, <i>definitely</i> not fueled by autism and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorderÂ®.
							 <br/><a href="#foot3" id="foot3_main">[3]</a>: to clarify: i have dabbled a lot with drawing things on pencil and paper since at a much younger age, and for quite a while too. i guess i am somewhat okay-ish at drawing stuff? still need to de-rust the rest of my drawing gears, though.
							 <br/><a href="#foot4" id="foot4_main">[4]</a>: yes, this <i>does</i> include kink-related ramblings. i <i>will</i> label it as appropriate and put up 18+ warnings before you access this sort of stuff.
